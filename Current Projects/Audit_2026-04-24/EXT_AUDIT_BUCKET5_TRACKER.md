# External Audit — Bucket 5 Tracker

Working through Bucket 5 of `EXT_AUDIT_TRIAGE_2026-04-24.md` autonomously. Owner-decision items (Bucket 2), Apple-block items (Bucket 3), and posture-deferred items (Bucket 4) stay untouched.

Each item: status (open / shipped) + commit SHA when shipped.

## Batch 28 — shipped (commit pending push)

| ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| E.4 | Comment depth client uses literal `< 2`; server reads DB | shipped — hoisted to `COMMENT_MAX_DEPTH` constant + comment linking schema/033 |
| K.3 | `breaking/page.tsx:50` hardcodes `'owner' \|\| 'admin'` | shipped — uses `ADMIN_ROLES.has(r)` |
| L.1 | data-export route missing `require_outranks` | shipped — `requireAdminOutranks` guard added |
| B.3 | NavWrapper substring tier matching | shipped — joined `plans!fk_users_plan_id(tier)`, deriveTier reads canonical tier string |
| W.5 | iOS pair-code length 8 vs server 6-16 | **deferred — needs UX call** (8-slot grid vs flexible input) |
| W.8 | Streak milestone missing day-3 | shipped — case 3 added with copy |
| K.5 | `pipeline/costs/page.tsx:164` `.range(0, 9999)` | shipped — capped to `.limit(1000)` |

## Batch 29 — shipped

| ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CC.1 | `toggle_follow` ignores blocked_users | shipped — schema/167 adds bidirectional block-relationship check |
| CC.7 | `approve_expert_answer` doesn't notify asker | shipped — schema/167 adds `create_notification` for the asker |
| E.2 | Kids PIN MAX_ATTEMPTS hardcoded | shipped — DB settings rows + cached helper read; constants are fallbacks |

## Batch 30 — A11y cluster (shipped)

| ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| NN.1 | Pages missing `<main>` | shipped — wrapped browse, leaderboard, bookmarks, notifications, messages |
| NN.3 | Browse category cards mouse-only | shipped — added `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, `onKeyDown` (Enter/Space), `aria-expanded`. Kept `<div>` because card content includes `<a>` which can't nest inside `<button>`. |
| JJ.2 | PermissionGate keyboard inaccessible | shipped — `onKeyDown` for Enter/Space + `aria-label` |
| JJ.1 | User ConfirmDialog no focus trap | shipped — focus capture/restore + Tab cycle + initial focus on Cancel |

## Batch 31 — Security/policy cluster (shipped)

| ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Y.1 | events/batch missing rate limit | shipped — 60 batches/min/IP |
| WW.1 | iOS webhooks no payload size cap | shipped — 256 KiB cap on appstore/notifications + subscriptions/sync (Stripe parity at 1 MiB) |
| AAA.6 | award_points cap-counting race | shipped — schema/168 adds `pg_advisory_xact_lock` keyed on (subject, action) |
| KK.1 | feeds POST accepts any URL | shipped — URL parse + http(s)-only + private/loopback host reject |

## Batch 32 — Email + push + scoring cluster (shipped)

| ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| LL.2 | No `List-Unsubscribe` header | shipped — RFC 8058 one-click headers via `sendEmail`; per-recipient URL or fallback to settings#emails |
| LL.3 | send-emails cron ignores quiet hours | shipped — quiet_hours_start/end loaded with prefs; deferred (not skipped) when current time falls inside |
| X.5 | Logout doesn't invalidate push tokens | shipped — POST /api/auth/logout marks user_push_tokens.invalidated_at = now() before signOut |
| AAA.4 | Recap pass not awarded points | shipped — schema/169 seeds `recap_pass` rule (6 pts) + rewires `submit_recap_attempt` to PERFORM `award_points` on >=60% pass |

## Batch 33 — Mega-batch: swallowed audits + billing audit + RLS + cleanup crons + misc (shipped)

| ID | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| D.1 | Stripe webhook swallows create_notification | shipped — 6 sites: silent catch → tagged console.error |
| D.2 | auth routes swallow audit_log | shipped — callback/login/signup audit_log inserts wrapped in try/catch + logged |
| D.3 | B18 webhook_handler_failed audit | already correct (logs on failure) |
| Q.2 | billing routes missing audit_log | shipped — cancel/change-plan/resubscribe each insert into audit_log post-RPC |
| O.7 | TTS button under 44pt touch target | shipped — padding 12x14 + minHeight 44 on `btn` and `btnGhost` styles |
| JJ.7 | Ad URL DB-level validation | shipped — POST /api/admin/ad-units validates http(s) on creative_url + click_url |
| CC.2 | claim_queue_item no TTL | shipped — schema/170 adds `release_stale_expert_claims(hours)` for cron use |
| CCC.2 | user_roles no UNIQUE(user_id, role_id) | shipped — schema/170 dedups + adds constraint |
| CCC.5 | rate_limit_events unbounded | shipped — schema/170 `cleanup_rate_limit_events(days)` + new cron route /api/cron/rate-limit-cleanup |
| GG.2 | quiz_attempts SELECT no kid-JWT branch | shipped — schema/171 adds `quiz_attempts_select_kid_jwt` policy |
| F.2 | Mentions soft-warn doesn't block submit | **intentional per in-code comment — closed without code change** |
| F.3 | v2_live banner | **deferred — UI design pass** |
| K.1 | Admin gate idiom harmonize | **deferred — 30+ file sweep** |
| L.3 | Permission-key drift naming sweep | **deferred — needs cross-cutting rename plan** |
| M.3 reset-revoke server-side | client-side already handles via `signOut({ scope: 'others' })` post-update — closed |
| KK.4 | Ingest ignores feeds.audience | **owner-decision** (unified-pool was deliberate) |
| AA.3 | Server-side age verification | **owner-decision** (requires DOB collection UX) |

## Owner-decision sub-bucket (added during Bucket 5 work)

| ID | Title | Question |
|---|---|---|
| W.5 | iOS pair-code length | 8-slot fixed grid (current) vs flexible 6-16 input field. Server today produces 8-char codes; aligning to server range needs UI redesign. |
| M.8 | Password rules to DB | Multi-file SSR/API delivery for client-side rules; needs design pass before extracting (signup form, settings, reset-password all read these). |
