### Bookmarks — OwnersAudit Tasks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 + extra

**Loading skeleton**
- **What** — Replaced `'Loading bookmarks…'` centered div with 4 skeleton card rows. Each skeleton matches the live card shape (`background: '#f7f7f7', border: '1px solid #e5e5e5', borderRadius: 10, padding: 16`) with two placeholder bars (14px title-height, 11px meta-height) animated via `@keyframes vp-pulse`. Skeleton `<main>` wrapper uses identical padding/background to the loaded state to avoid layout jump.
- **Files** — `web/src/app/bookmarks/page.tsx`
- **Why** — OwnersAudit Bookmarks Task 1.

**Undo toast on bookmark remove**
- **What** — Replaced immediate-DELETE `removeBookmark(id: string)` with an optimistic-remove + 5-second undo pattern. Item is removed from state instantly; a persistent toast shows "Bookmark removed" + inline Undo button. Undo restores the item at its original index. After 5 s the DELETE fires; on failure the item is restored and `setError` is called. Timer Map (`useRef<Map<string, timeout>>`) keyed by bookmark ID prevents timer collision when multiple items are removed before any window closes. Added `useEffect` cleanup to clear all pending timers on unmount.
- **Files** — `web/src/app/bookmarks/page.tsx`
- **Why** — OwnersAudit Bookmarks Task 2.

**Touch targets**
- **What** — Added `minHeight: 44` to Remove button, collection × delete button, and + Add note button. Added `minHeight: 36` to collection filter pills, `btnSolid`, and `btnGhost` (fixing Export, New collection, Create, Cancel, Save, Load more in one edit).
- **Files** — `web/src/app/bookmarks/page.tsx`
- **Why** — OwnersAudit Bookmarks Task 3.

**Button label renames**
- **What** — `'Export JSON'` → `'Download my bookmarks'`; `'+ Collection'` → `'New collection'`.
- **Files** — `web/src/app/bookmarks/page.tsx`
- **Why** — OwnersAudit Bookmarks Task 5.

**iOS "Please sign in" copy**
- **What** — `errorText = "Please sign in."` → `"Sign in to manage your bookmarks."` in the auth-session-missing branch of `removeBookmark`.
- **Files** — `VerityPost/VerityPost/BookmarksView.swift`
- **Why** — OwnersAudit Bookmarks Task 6.

**Article title `<a>` → `<Link>` (extra)**
- **What** — Replaced `<a href={`/story/${b.articles?.slug}`}>` with `<Link href={...} prefetch={false}>`. Slug guard (`b.articles?.slug ? \`/story/...\` : '#'`) prevents broken href when join returns null. `prefetch={false}` avoids mass prefetch on long bookmark lists.
- **Files** — `web/src/app/bookmarks/page.tsx`
- **Why** — Internal nav must use Next.js Link; raw `<a>` skips client-side routing. `prefetch={false}` is standard for list items.

### Leaderboard — OwnersAudit Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4

**Removed Weekly tab**
- **What** — Removed `'Weekly'` from the `TABS` constant and its corresponding data-fetch branch from the second `useEffect`. Weekly was a duplicate of Top Verifiers + This Week — identical RPC call, same cutoff, same results.
- **Files** — `web/src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx`
- **Why** — OwnersAudit Leaderboard Task 2. IA cleanup: tabs should answer "rank by what," not mix ranking mode with time window.

**Removed expand drawer; streak shown inline**
- **What** — Removed the tap-to-expand row drawer (5 `StatRow` bars: Score, Articles Read, Quizzes Passed, Comments, Streak). Rows are now static. Streak is surfaced inline below the username as `"{n} day streak"` when non-zero. Cleaned up all associated state (`expanded`, `setExpanded`), props (`onToggle`, `expanded`, `topScore`, `topReads`, `topQuizzes`, `topComments`, `topStreak`), the `StatRow` import, and the row-level ARIA button attributes (`role`, `tabIndex`, `onKeyDown`, `aria-expanded`).
- **Files** — `web/src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx`
- **Why** — OwnersAudit Leaderboard Task 1. Reduce chrome between page load and list content. The expand drawer added interaction overhead for stats that weren't the ranking criterion.

**Period filter pill touch target**
- **What** — Added `minHeight: 36` to period filter pill button style.
- **Files** — `web/src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx`
- **Why** — OwnersAudit Leaderboard Task 3. Pills rendered at ~26px with no minimum; 36px is the audit-specified floor for secondary filter pills inline with other controls.

**Period labels sentence case (web + iOS)**
- **What** — Changed `PERIOD_LABELS` from `['This Week', 'This Month', 'All Time']` to `['This week', 'This month', 'All time']`. Updated `WINDOW_DAYS` object keys to match. Updated all four string comparisons/references in `page.tsx`. Updated Swift enum `rawValue` strings to match.
- **Files** — `web/src/lib/leaderboardPeriod.ts`, `web/src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx`, `VerityPost/VerityPost/LeaderboardPeriod.swift`
- **Why** — OwnersAudit Leaderboard Task 4. Product standard is sentence case for all UI labels.
